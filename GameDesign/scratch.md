# differentiating this game from __Fantasy Defense__
this game is based on SN Mobile Technology's __Fantasy Defense__, but i want to
sufficiently differentiate it as a game, primarily for artistic integrity but
also as a matter of avoiding legal complications involving copyright.

## things i want to keep from Fantasy Defense

### the grid
placing units in some finite number of squares is more chill than placing them
in arbitrary positions (cause otherwise players have to use [finicky] touch
screens to try to optimize unit layout).

note that i could also solve this by allowing players to place units right on
top of each other (i think Bloons TD might do this for certain units?), but i
don't like the way that looks, and that also feels like a "more chaotic, higher
energy" game type of thing.

### the enemy path
knowing where enemies are going to travel enables strategy by showing the
player (e.g., where an archer's range can cover the most tiles)


## things i could try that are different

### the art in general
i could go for a narrower and hopefully more interesting aesthetic than the
"general fantasy" look __Fantasy Defense__ seems to go for.

don't get me wrong, i actually love the character designs in that game, but in
my opinion the aesthetic is not as immersive as it could be. it could do more
to set itself apart from other anime fantasy games.

### the character designs
all of the character designs are a big, fit humanoid with lavish armor. there's
lots of opportunity for variety here.

could incorporate "fantasy races" like moogles and building units like watch
towers.

### units with non-circular ranges
could make things interesting imo, to have units that only attack straight
ahead, or units that attack on both sides at once (like Donkey Kong's
down-smash in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate)

### units that move
it might be interesting to have units that move within some range? not sure how
this would work yet.

maybe a unit that patrols - a guy who does a ton of damage in one slow hit but
the tradeoff is that he isn't always around ? (but how do i communicate to the
player that he needs a patrol path of a certain length?)

### pierce damage
e.g., a javelin thrower that is set up to fire straight down a path, doing
damage to anything walking on it

### AOE2 monk
converts enemies to fight for you! they'd need to be super slow to stay
balanced if converting an enemy is basically an insta-kill. OR they can be
temporarily converted

### blockades
maybe players can place things directly on the path that block or slow enemies.

delving deeper into this, maybe if enemy paths were very complex, blockades
could become pretty interesting, where a level starts out with "we cannot reach
every enemy going through" and becomes "we are routing the enemies into our
defenses" with skillful play

### other on-path objects
this is a "type of thing" i can think about when imagining new mechanics

### fog of war
enjoying leaning into the __Age of Empires II__ influence here.
